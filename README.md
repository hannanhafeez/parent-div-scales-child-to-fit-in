# Parent element scales and fits child element (React)

This is a React/Next.js demo project which shows how you can scale child element in parent to fit vertically or horizontally. The resize happens on windo resize event. 

Refer [`page/index.tsx`](https://github.com/hannanhafeez/parent-div-scales-child-to-fit-in/blob/master/pages/index.tsx) and [`page/index.module.css`](https://github.com/hannanhafeez/parent-div-scales-child-to-fit-in/blob/master/pages/index.module.css) to see parent and child styles and [`hooks/useChildScaleToFirParent.ts`](https://github.com/hannanhafeez/parent-div-scales-child-to-fit-in/blob/master/hooks/useChildScaleToFitParent.ts) to understand the logic of scaling for different orientaion combinations for both parent and child.
